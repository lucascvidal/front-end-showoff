# Front-End Showoff

This was designed to be a Front-End Showoff.

I have been wanting to dive deeper into CSS Animations for quite some time, and I figured this project was a good opportunity to do so. I’m a mechanical engineer that has shifted carreers towards software development, and since 2020, also software engineering. The stuff I studied the most before actually getting a job in the industry was front-end development, specially CSS.

When I started working as a software developer I had close to none real back-end experience. I knew a bit of web development, but just enough to get past the problem sets presented by the courses I took. I was lucky to work with very experienced and seasoned developers and engineers. Some of them took me under their wing and I learned a lot from those experiences. However, there was one thing I could do from the first day in the job that they couldn’t do. They could not code proper CSS and HTML. Not for their lives.

Then I realized I actually had the talent for coding everything the designers threw at me during the development of the products we were involved in. Since then, I became the front-end specialist in the team. As a specialist, I have to admit I felt ashamed of not understanding CSS animations at a deeper level.

That is were this project comes in. This is a Spotify clone, with a few touches of interesting bits I encountered during my days as a software developer. I wanted to mix stuff commonly present in applications development with animations, which are often left aside because of the extra time needed to implement them.

I hope you enjoyed seeing and reading this.

## Development information

If you by any chance want to use this repository as reference and need a bit of information about the tools I'm using here, this is the section you have been looking for.

I'm using a dev container within VS Code. The dev container is a Linux container with Node.js and Sass already installed. The SCSS files can be compiled using:
```shell
sass styles.scss styles.css
```

## What I Learned
